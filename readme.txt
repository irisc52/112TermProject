Title and Description


For the Summer 2024 Olympics, the New York Times created mini, often sped up 3D simulations of swimming and running races. They were received very well as a clear and quick visual tool that can be replayed and reanalyzed. As visualization is important to swimmers of all levels, my Term Project aims to create a similar version of these simulations where any swimmer can input their best times or goal times and watch how that race would look. Different modes allow for a variety of uses, including exact splits or race split predictions. 


Run Instructions


To run the project, run main.py. There is a description in the homescreen and each screen has instructions that the user will be able to follow. Once the pool screen is reached, press p to start the race; then, the race will run and will follow with race analytics. No outside modules were used.
